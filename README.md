ðŸ§ª Drug Discovery with Regression Models on SMILES

This project leverages machine learning, specifically regression models, to streamline the drug discovery process. By training models on the SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) representations of molecules, we aim to predict key molecular properties such as lipophilicity (AlogP) and ligand interaction metrics (BEI, LLE, LE, SEI).

Using AI, this approach helps reduce the high cost, time, and complexity associated with traditional drug development, making the process faster and more efficient.
